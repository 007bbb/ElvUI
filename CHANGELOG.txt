*Removed some old code that was used to keep ElvUI working with patch 4.2.
*Re-Add scale restriction so you can't set UIScale below .64.
*Add support to the keybind mode for all gaming mouses.
*Enable/Disable unitframes should no longer require reload ui. This change also fixes people disabling a frame and seeing the default Blizzard frame popping up after a restart.
