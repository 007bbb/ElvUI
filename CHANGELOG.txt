*Removed some old code that was used to keep ElvUI working with patch 4.2.
*Re-Add scale restriction so you can't set UIScale below .64.
*Add support to the keybind mode for all gaming mouses.
*Enable/Disable unitframes should no longer require reload ui. This change also fixes people disabling a frame and seeing the default Blizzard frame popping up after a reload or restart.
*Fix strata issue I noticed on shaman, debuff highlighting and incomming heals were appearing above the Totem bar.
*Fix logic error with the BGMap skin, should now set alphas correctly when mousing in and out of the frame.
